# A Python web crawler for data analysis


#### Abstract 
The objective of this study is to construct an object-oriented data collection program, which is able to retrieve data from \url{https://twitter.com}, archive it in an established data format and analyze it using specific algorithms and sorting methods. The project will provide an in-depth explanation of how the functionality of Python and its libraries are utilized, in order to build and store data. Furthermore, the study will explore different ways in which data can be processed, in order to enhance the understanding of it from a statistical viewpoint. This is supported with core concepts of software engineering, concerning system requirement specification and agile software engineering processes.
